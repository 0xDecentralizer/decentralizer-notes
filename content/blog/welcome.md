## Why This Site Exists

I'm building **Decentralizer Notes** to document my journey learning Solidity and Web3 development. This is my commitment to learning in public.

### The Plan

Here's what I'm focusing on:

1. **Solidity Fundamentals** - Deepening my intermediate knowledge
2. **Smart Contract Security** - Understanding common vulnerabilities
3. **dApp Development** - Building full-stack Web3 applications
4. **JavaScript/Next.js** - Improving my frontend skills

### What You'll Find Here

This site will contain:

- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides on Solidity concepts
- **Project Logs** - Updates on what I'm building
- **Learning Notes** - Weekly summaries of what I learned
- **Resources** - Useful links and references

## Learning in Public

I believe the best way to learn is by:

```solidity
// 1. Building real projects
contract LearningContract {
    string public message = "Build, break, learn, repeat";
}
```

```javascript
// 2. Sharing the journey
const learning = {
  method: "public",
  benefits: ["accountability", "community", "portfolio"]
}
```

## What's Next?

I'm currently working on understanding:

- Gas optimization techniques
- Upgradeable smart contracts
- Testing with Hardhat and Foundry

Stay tuned for more posts!
