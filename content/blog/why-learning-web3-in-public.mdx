# Why I'm Learning Web3 in Public

Welcome to my first blog post! I'm starting this site to document my journey learning Solidity, smart contracts, and Web3 development.

## The Decision to Learn in Public

I've been learning Solidity for a few months now, and I've realized that teaching others is one of the best ways to solidify my own understanding. By sharing what I learn, I hope to:

1. **Reinforce my learning** - Explaining concepts forces me to understand them deeply
2. **Help others** - If I struggled with something, others probably will too
3. **Build a portfolio** - Showcase my progress and projects
4. **Stay accountable** - Regular updates keep me motivated
5. **Connect with the community** - Meet other learners and developers

## What I'm Learning

Right now, I'm at an intermediate level with Solidity. I can write basic smart contracts, understand how the EVM works, and I'm getting comfortable with tools like Hardhat and Foundry.

I'm also learning JavaScript and Next.js to build full-stack dApps. This very site is my first Next.js project!

## What to Expect

I'll be posting:

- **Tutorials** - Breaking down complex Solidity concepts
- **Project updates** - Sharing what I'm building
- **Weekly learning logs** - What I learned, resources I found helpful
- **Mistakes and lessons** - Because failures teach us the most

## Let's Connect

If you're on a similar journey, I'd love to connect! You can find me on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername) - Check out my projects
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yourusername) - Follow along with my daily learnings

Thanks for reading, and let's build the decentralized future together! 🚀

## Resources I'm Using

Here are some resources that have been incredibly helpful so far:

- [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) - The official docs
- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/) - Secure, audited contract templates
- [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) - Fun, interactive Solidity tutorial
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) - My favorite development environment
